Me and my friends gather at my house every sunday. One of those sundays we started to play Nintendo switch and Mario Kart game. 
Life was never the same after that sunday. We started to play veryyyy competitive and we needed to track results.
It is not possible to write on paper when you have developer in a house.
I have created a scoring system and developed this application. 
It was a lot of fun because I was developing .NET web application at my work, I needed to test various stuff and not ruin production.
In the end I have managed to test out all stuff and my friends got cool application to have fun with. Win Win situation.
